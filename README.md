##### Format
This will be an interactive game application. We will use a complete storyline (such as "Xiao Ming's Study Abroad Diary in Germany") or several smaller stories, depending on the actual development conditions, to cover all the learning content mentioned above. Through realistic and engaging situational simulations, students will gain knowledge and experience. Afterwards, students will be presented with a series of similar scenarios and asked to determine the appropriate ways to handle them. AI will score their responses, testing whether they have genuinely mastered the relevant content.  
##### Theoretical Framework
The Experiential Learning Theory (ELT) proposaed by David Kolb, it is a learning framework that emphasizes gaining knowledge through a continuous cycle of experience, reflection, conceptualization, and experimentation. Especially it's four-stage learning cycle:  
1. Concrete Experience (CE)
- The learner gains direct sensory and emotional experiences through active participation in activities.
- Example: Participating in actual experiments, projects, or simulations.
2. Reflective Observation (RO)
- The learner reviews the experience and analyzes what happened.
- Example: Observing one’s own or others’ behavior and reflecting on the successes and challenges of the activity.
3. Abstract Conceptualization (AC)
- The learner translates reflections into theories or models.
- Example: Summarizing practical experiences into rules or theoretical concepts.
4. Active Experimentation (AE)
- The learner applies new knowledge to practice and experiments with new behaviors.
- Example: Testing new solutions or methods in real-life situations.
