# Project Proposal

### Target audience
The application is designed specifically for **international students preparing to study in Germany**. These students often face challenges in adapting to daily life abroad due to cultural, linguistic, and procedural differences. The app aims to bridge this gap by providing practical knowledge and interactive experiences tailored to their needs. 
### Purpose and Goals
The primary goal of the application is to **equip students with essential skills and knowledge to navigate everyday situations in Germany confidently**. By addressing topics such as emergencies, cultural norms, public transportation, accommodation, and basic language survival, the app ensures that students are better prepared for real-world scenarios and can integrate smoothly into their new environment.
### Format
This will be an interactive game application. We will use a complete storyline (such as "Xiao Ming's Study Abroad Diary in Germany") or several smaller stories, depending on the actual development conditions, to cover all the learning content. Through realistic and engaging situational simulations, students will gain knowledge and experience. Afterwards, students will be presented with a series of similar scenarios and asked to determine the appropriate ways to handle them. AI will score their responses, testing whether they have genuinely mastered the relevant content. 
### Key Features
1. Interactive Storyline
- The app uses a dynamic and engaging story-driven format, such as "Xiao Ming's Study Abroad Diary in Germany", to present learning content.
- The storyline unfolds through a series of interconnected scenarios, mimicking real-life challenges students might face, like navigating public transport or dealing with medical emergencies.
2. Scenario Simulations
- Each scenario offers realistic situational simulations, allowing students to interact with their environment and make choices that impact the storyline's progression.
- For example, a student might choose how to respond to a sudden subway delay or decide what documents to bring when registering for accommodation.
3. Immediate Feedback and Guidance
- After each interaction, the app provides context-sensitive feedback and explains why certain choices are better, helping students reflect on their decisions.
4. Skill Assessment
- Following the simulation, students encounter similar but slightly altered scenarios to assess whether they’ve internalized the lessons.
- An AI-driven scoring system evaluates their responses, measuring mastery and offering personalized recommendations for improvement.
5. Gamified Learning
- To maintain engagement, the app incorporates gamification elements, such as achievement badges, progress trackers, and rewards for completing levels or excelling in specific topics.

### Theoretical Framework/Learning Approach
The Experiential Learning Theory (ELT) proposaed by David Kolb, it is a learning framework that emphasizes gaining knowledge through a continuous cycle of experience, reflection, conceptualization, and experimentation. Especially it's four-stage learning cycle:  
1. Concrete Experience (CE)
- The learner gains direct sensory and emotional experiences through active participation in activities.
- Example: Participating in actual experiments, projects, or simulations.
2. Reflective Observation (RO)
- The learner reviews the experience and analyzes what happened.
- Example: Observing one’s own or others’ behavior and reflecting on the successes and challenges of the activity.
3. Abstract Conceptualization (AC)
- The learner translates reflections into theories or models.
- Example: Summarizing practical experiences into rules or theoretical concepts.
4. Active Experimentation (AE)
- The learner applies new knowledge to practice and experiments with new behaviors.
- Example: Testing new solutions or methods in real-life situations.
### Research Questions (Example)
1. Concrete Experience (CE)
- RQ1: Do more immersive and realistic simulation scenarios encourage students to spend more time exploring?
  - Data to collect: Time spent in each scenario, frequency of interactions with objects or characters within the simulation.
- RQ2: Do students show significant differences in exploration time across scenarios with different topics (e.g., cultural norms, language skills)?
  - Data to collect: Comparison of time spent in scenarios related to various topics.
2. Reflective Observation (RO)
- RQ3: Are students who review their decisions or errors through feedback reports more likely to achieve higher accuracy in subsequent similar scenarios?
  - Data to collect: Number of clicks to view feedback or review reports and the correlation with scores or success rates in subsequent scenarios.
- RQ4: Is the time students spend in the reflection phase positively correlated with their level of knowledge mastery?
  - Data to collect: Time spent on the reflection pages, usage frequency and depth of note-taking tools (if available), and their relation to test performance.
3. Abstract Conceptualization (AC)
  - RQ5: After completing multiple scenarios, can students generalize behavioral patterns, such as choosing the correct options more quickly in similar emergency situations?
    - Data to collect: Changes in average response time and accuracy across different scenarios as learning progresses.
  - RQ6: After repeatedly encountering a particular type of situation (e.g., transportation rules), do students demonstrate faster learning transfer when introduced to new scenarios on the same topic?
    - Data to collect: Proportion of correct answers chosen on the first attempt and response time in new scenarios.
4. Active Experimentation (AE)
- RQ7: Do students who learn through trial-and-error outperform those who follow direct prompts in subsequent tests?
  - Data to collect: Frequency of incorrect choices, active revisions of decisions during simulations, and their test score comparisons.
- RQ8: Is the frequency of innovative problem-solving attempts in new scenarios related to the depth of reflection in previous scenarios?
  - Data to collect: Frequency of non-standard option selections in new scenarios and their relationship to time spent or interactions during the reflection phase.
5. Overall Effectiveness of the Application (Validating the ELT Cycle)
- RQ9: Do students who complete all four stages of the ELT cycle (Experience-Reflect-Conceptualize-Experiment) perform better than those who participate in only some stages?
  - Data to collect: Students' participation levels in different learning stages (e.g., number of scenarios completed, quantity of reflection notes, test performance) and their overall scores.
- RQ10: Does completing the entire learning cycle significantly improve students' ability to handle real-life situations?
  - Data to collect: Feedback on students' behavior in real-life contexts after completing the application (e.g., through surveys or observational studies).
### Expected Impact
By using this application, students will:
- Develop a deeper understanding of daily life in Germany through hands-on practice.
- Build confidence in managing common challenges, reducing anxiety and culture shock.
- Gain practical skills that directly translate into their real-world experiences abroad.
### Programming Language
Depends on the needs. TBD. We might use some existing repositries/tools. For example, the visual novel engine [renpy](https://www.renpy.org/) for story simulation games.
