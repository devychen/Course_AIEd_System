# Course Education System for AI

### Credit Points
6 credits graded. **Team member**: Yifei Chen, Kathy Yang. <br>
**Requirements**: a prototype of a AI-supported education application.

### Project Proposal
**Learning through games** <br>
Idea: <br>
We want to create a web game to help students practice vocabulary. The target students are foreigners studying IELTS and wanted to take IELTS exams. We will be using previous IELTS reading materials and IELTS must-learn vocabulary. <br>
The idea comes from an old typing practice game called _Catch Me If You Can (警察抓小偷)_ developed by Kingsoft (金山軟件).
