  - Importance of being on time and how lateness is perceived.
- Public Etiquette:
  - Speaking softly in public spaces.
  - Queueing and respecting personal space.
- Dining Habits:
  - Tipping culture in restaurants.
  - Splitting the bill ("separat zahlen") and asking for tap water.
- Recycling and Sustainability:
  - Germany’s recycling system (colored bins).
  - Avoiding waste (e.g., returning bottles for deposit – Pfand).
- Public Holidays and Quiet Hours:
  - Noisy activities prohibited on Sundays.
  - Understanding holiday closures for stores.
3. Transportation
- Using Public Transport:
  - How to read timetables, buy tickets, and avoid fines for traveling without a valid ticket.
  - Types of transportation: U-Bahn, S-Bahn, bus, and tram.
- Cycling:
  - Rules for cycling safely.
  - Using bike lanes and parking etiquette.
- Long-Distance Travel:
  - Booking trains (DB Navigator app) and understanding seat reservations.
  - Budget travel tips (e.g., FlixBus, regional tickets).
4. Accommodation and Housing
- Finding a Place to Stay:
  - Renting procedures, vocabulary for contracts (e.g., "Kaltmiete," "Nebenkosten").
  - Understanding WG (shared apartments) culture.
- Registering Your Address:
  - The importance of “Anmeldung” and how to do it.
- Living with Others:
  - Shared responsibilities in a WG (cleaning, taking out trash).
  - House rules (e.g., noise restrictions).
5. Language Survival Skills
- Common Phrases:
  - Basic conversational German for daily use (e.g., greetings, shopping, asking for help).
- Reading Signs:
  - Recognizing important signs: "Ausgang" (exit), "Eingang" (entrance), etc.
- Online Translators and Apps:
  - Recommendations for translation apps (Google Translate, Deepl).
  - Learning German gradually through apps (e.g., Duolingo).
6. Shopping and Dining
- Grocery Shopping:
  - Navigating German supermarkets and understanding packaging (e.g., "Bio").
  - Using self-checkout systems.
- Eating Out:
  - How to order food in a restaurant or café.
  - Common dishes and dietary considerations.
- Cash vs. Card:
  - Understanding that many places prefer cash.
  - How to withdraw money or exchange currency.
### Format
This will be an interactive game application. We will use a complete storyline (such as "Xiao Ming's Study Abroad Diary in Germany") or several smaller stories, depending on the actual development conditions, to cover all the learning content mentioned above. Through realistic and engaging situational simulations, students will gain knowledge and experience. Afterwards, students will be presented with a series of similar scenarios and asked to determine the appropriate ways to handle them. AI will score their responses, testing whether they have genuinely mastered the relevant content.  
### Theoretical Framework
The Experiential Learning Theory (ELT) proposaed by David Kolb, it is a learning framework that emphasizes gaining knowledge through a continuous cycle of experience, reflection, conceptualization, and experimentation. Especially it's four-stage learning cycle:  
1. Concrete Experience (CE)
- The learner gains direct sensory and emotional experiences through active participation in activities.
- Example: Participating in actual experiments, projects, or simulations.
2. Reflective Observation (RO)
- The learner reviews the experience and analyzes what happened.
- Example: Observing one’s own or others’ behavior and reflecting on the successes and challenges of the activity.
3. Abstract Conceptualization (AC)
- The learner translates reflections into theories or models.
- Example: Summarizing practical experiences into rules or theoretical concepts.
4. Active Experimentation (AE)
- The learner applies new knowledge to practice and experiments with new behaviors.
- Example: Testing new solutions or methods in real-life situations.
### Research Questions (Example)
1. Concrete Experience (CE)
- RQ1: Do more immersive and realistic simulation scenarios encourage students to spend more time exploring?
  - Data to collect: Time spent in each scenario, frequency of interactions with objects or characters within the simulation.
- RQ2: Do students show significant differences in exploration time across scenarios with different topics (e.g., cultural norms, language skills)?
  - Data to collect: Comparison of time spent in scenarios related to various topics.
2. Reflective Observation (RO)
- RQ3: Are students who review their decisions or errors through feedback reports more likely to achieve higher accuracy in subsequent similar scenarios?
  - Data to collect: Number of clicks to view feedback or review reports and the correlation with scores or success rates in subsequent scenarios.
- RQ4: Is the time students spend in the reflection phase positively correlated with their level of knowledge mastery?
  - Data to collect: Time spent on the reflection pages, usage frequency and depth of note-taking tools (if available), and their relation to test performance.
3. Abstract Conceptualization (AC)
  - RQ5: After completing multiple scenarios, can students generalize behavioral patterns, such as choosing the correct options more quickly in similar emergency situations?
    - Data to collect: Changes in average response time and accuracy across different scenarios as learning progresses.
  - RQ6: After repeatedly encountering a particular type of situation (e.g., transportation rules), do students demonstrate faster learning transfer when introduced to new scenarios on the same topic?
    - Data to collect: Proportion of correct answers chosen on the first attempt and response time in new scenarios.
4. Active Experimentation (AE)
- RQ7: Do students who learn through trial-and-error outperform those who follow direct prompts in subsequent tests?
  - Data to collect: Frequency of incorrect choices, active revisions of decisions during simulations, and their test score comparisons.
- RQ8: Is the frequency of innovative problem-solving attempts in new scenarios related to the depth of reflection in previous scenarios?
  - Data to collect: Frequency of non-standard option selections in new scenarios and their relationship to time spent or interactions during the reflection phase.
5. Overall Effectiveness of the Application (Validating the ELT Cycle)
- RQ9: Do students who complete all four stages of the ELT cycle (Experience-Reflect-Conceptualize-Experiment) perform better than those who participate in only some stages?
  - Data to collect: Students' participation levels in different learning stages (e.g., number of scenarios completed, quantity of reflection notes, test performance) and their overall scores.
- RQ10: Does completing the entire learning cycle significantly improve students' ability to handle real-life situations?
  - Data to collect: Feedback on students' behavior in real-life contexts after completing the application (e.g., through surveys or observational studies).
